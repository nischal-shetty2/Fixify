# **AI-Driven Automated Interviewing Platform**

## **Overview**
The AI-Driven Automated Interviewing Platform is an intelligent solution designed to evaluate candidates' technical skills, coding abilities, and behavioral traits in a simulated real-world interview environment. Leveraging AI and advanced algorithms, the platform enables organizations to make data-driven hiring decisions with confidence. 

---

## **Features**
### **1. Programming Question Management**
- Post one or more programming questions with predefined input/output expectations and evaluation benchmarks.
- Support for multiple question types, including algorithmic challenges, debugging tasks, and design problems.

### **2. Code Writing and Execution**
- Integrated code editor with:
  - **Syntax Highlighting** for improved readability.
  - **IntelliSense** for autocompletions.
  - **Auto-Formatting** to standardize code layout.
- Compile, debug, and submit code directly on the platform.

### **3. Code Evaluation**
- **Correctness**: Compare candidate solutions against test cases, including edge cases.
- **Error Handling**: Evaluate how well solutions handle boundary conditions and exceptions.

### **4. AI-Driven Code Quality Assessment**
- Assess code for:
  - **Readability**: Variable naming, comments, and indentation.
  - **Performance**: Time and space efficiency.
  - **Security**: Detect vulnerabilities and unsafe practices.
  - **Maintainability**: Adherence to industry standards.

### **5. Behavioral Insights**
- Use AI to analyze text-based responses to assess communication skills and personality traits.
- Provide actionable insights into candidates' problem-solving approaches and teamwork compatibility.

### **6. Scalability**
- Support multiple programming languages, starting with Python and expanding to Java, GoLang, JavaScript, and PHP.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React.js with [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) for the code editor.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, and Python for AI-driven code analysis.
- **Database**: MongoDB for question management and submission tracking.
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI APIs or custom-trained models for personality insights and code analysis.

---

## **Getting Started**
### **1. Prerequisites**
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Python 3.8+ for AI-related tasks.
